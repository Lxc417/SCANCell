# SCANCell
SCANCell is a new analysis pipeline that unveils the hidden association networks of clusters for high dimensional cytometry data analysis. 
SCANCell first depicts the immune phenotype of  biological cohorts and classifies samples from the same experimental group  into different subgroups using PhEMD (https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/phemd). 
Then SCANCell  computes the PMI values between clusters and constructs DA networks.
